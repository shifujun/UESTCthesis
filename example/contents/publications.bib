abstract = "Novel 4''-O-benzimidazolyl clarithromycin derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These benzimidazolyl derivatives exhibited excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible strains better than the references, and some of them showed greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant strains. Compounds 16 and 17, which have the terminal 2-(4-methylphenyl)benzimidazolyl and 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)benzimidazolyl groups on the C-4'' bishydrazide side chains, were the most active against erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus pneumoniae expressing the erm gene and the mef gene. In addition, compound 17 exhibited the highest activity against erythromycin-susceptible S.?pneumoniae ATCC49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 as well. It is worth noting that the 4''-O-(2-aryl)benzimidazolyl derivatives show higher activity against erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant strains than the 4''-O-(2-alkyl)benzimidazolyl derivatives."

abstract = "Three novel structural series of C-4'' modified azithromycin analogs with two amide groups, which were connected by different alkyl linkage, were designed, prepared and evaluated for their in?vitro antibacterial activity against seven phenotypes of respiratory pathogens. Among them, 7d, 8j and 9j, as representatives of corresponding series, exhibited remarkably improved activity against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae expressing the erm gene, the mef gene, and the erm and mef genes. In addition, 7a–c, 7f–h, 7j, 8d, 8g, 8i, 9a–b and 9i displayed favorable efficacy against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae A22072 expressing the mef gene."
